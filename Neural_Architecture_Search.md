Zen-NAS is a lightning fast, training-free Neural Architecture Searching (NAS) algorithm for automatically designing deep neural networks with high prediction accuracy and high inference speed on GPU and mobile device.

### _Searching Speed and Model Performance on ImageNet-1k._ 

Zen-NAS is able to search over 1 million networks within 12 GPU hours, achieving SOTA ImageNet-1k performance and outperforming training-based NAS methods.
